## SOLID principles

- S = Single Responsibility - Each class/instance should have only 1 responsibility
- O = Open Closed - Objects should be open for extension closed for modification
- L = Liskov substitution - Instance objects can be replaced with subtypes without altering correctness
- I = Interface Segregation - Multiple specific interfaces are better than big general one
- D = Dependency Injection - High level and Low level modules should both depend on abstraction

## Other design principles

- Code to interface not implementation
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Encapsulate what changes
- Strive for loose coupling between objects
- Principle of least knowledge = Talk only to immediate friends
