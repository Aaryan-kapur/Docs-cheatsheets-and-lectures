**Primitive description:**

- ETH networks are used to transfer money and store data
- Different ETH networks
- Networks are formed by one or more nodes
- Each node is a machine running an ETH client
- Anyone can run a node
- Each node can contain a full copy of the blockchain

You can also create your own private ETH network for testing etc. There is not just one network; there are many.
